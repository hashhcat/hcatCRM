## Type hashtable:
A TypeScript type defined with key indexing ```([key: string])``` specifying that all keys must be *strings* and all associated values must also be *strings*. In other words, it defines a **structure** for a table where each key and its associated value are both *strings*.

## Type Options:
An interface that defines the **structure** of available options. It has two properties:

```base```: An *integer* that appears to determine the base for hashing operations.\
```len``` (optional): An *integer* that could represent the length or another relevant characteristic for hashing operations, although in your example, it's marked as optional.\

## Interface Hashcat:
A TypeScript interface that defines the **structure** of a Hashcat object.

```table```: A field of type hashtable, representing a hash table where each key is a *string* and each associated value is also a *string*.
maxbase: An *integer* that appears to represent the maximum possible value for the base property in the options.\
```defaultopt```: A field of type Options, representing the default options for hashing operations.
